# Coding-Challenge-10-Cards
This project is a short coding challenge created in VueJs . This app takes an api and displays it on 10 cards in 2 rows of 5. The hardest part was configuring fetch to work with vue, it is much easier and efficient to use the axios dependency. Each time you click on a card it reloads from the server and you get a random dog. This project could be altered to keep the same dog on each card and only change to a random dog on hard refresh. Or dog photos could be loaded asynchronously. 

This was created with Vue 3 using the composition API
